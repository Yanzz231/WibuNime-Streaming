**Note**: this module uses recent discordjs features and requires discord.js version 12.

Discord Player is a powerful [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) module that allows you to easily implement music commands. **Everything** is customizable, and everything is done to simplify your work **without limiting you**! It doesn't require any api key, as it uses **scraping**.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save discord-player
```

Install **@discordjs/opus**:

```sh
npm install --save @discordjs/opus
```

Install [FFMPEG](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) and you're done!

## Features

🤘 Easy to use!  
🎸 You can apply some cool filters (bassboost, reverse, 8D, etc...)  
🎼 Manage your server queues with simple functions (add songs, skip the current song, pause the music, resume it, etc...)!  
🌐 Multi-servers support

## Getting Started

Here is the code you will need to get started with discord-player. Then, you will be able to use `client.player` everywhere in your code!

```js
const Discord = require("discord.js"),
client = new Discord.Client(),
settings = {
    prefix: "!",
    token: "Your Discord Token"
};

const { Player } = require("discord-player");
// Create a new Player (you don't need any API Key)
const player = new Player(client);
// To easily access the player
client.player = player;
// add the trackStart event so when a song will be played this message will be sent
client.player.on('trackStart', (message, track) => message.channel.send(`Now playing ${track.title}...`))

client.on("ready", () => {
    console.log("I'm ready !");
});

client.on("message", async (message) => {

    const args = message.content.slice(settings.prefix.length).trim().split(/ +/g);
    const command = args.shift().toLowerCase();

    // !play Despacito
    // will play "Despacito" in the member voice channel

    if(command === "play"){
        client.player.play(message, args[0]);
        // as we registered the event above, no need to send a success message here
    }

});

client.login(settings.token);
```
